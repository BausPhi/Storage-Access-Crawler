# Storage-Access-Crawler

Storage-Access-Crawler is a web crawler that is implemented as part of my master thesis 
`Escaping the Cookie Prison: An in-depth Analysis of Storage Access API Usage on the Web` and can be used to uncover 
the usage of the Storage Access API on the web.

The crawler is based on the crawling framework implemented by Rautenstrauch et al. for their paper 
`To Auth or Not To Auth? A Comparative Analysis of the Pre- and Post-Login Security Landscape` which was released on 
[IEEE S&P 2024](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2024/313000a094/1Ub232sRVao).
